<p>
    Application takes localization from the device on which it's running. Unsupported localization display texts from
    default localization (English). Current version supports English, Slovak and Czech localizations. For all other
    languages default English localization will be used.
</p>
<p>
    Information about flowers which are displayed on detail screen is different issue. Texts are downloaded from a
    server which currently supports only two languages: English and Slovak. If localization's language doesn't match
    preferred language Google Translate icon will appear on detailed screen just next to information about flower. Touch
    this icon to translate information to your localization's language using Google Translate. Touch again to return
    back information in preferred language.
</p>
<p>
    Example 1: Jan is using Czech language (localization) on his phone. Application supports this localization so all
    application's text will be shown in Czech. Jan chooses Slovak as his preferred language in Settings (the application
    doesn't support Czech as preferred language yet). Application server will send information texts in Slovak because
    Jan didn't change application's localization (check box Change localization stays unchecked). Google Translate icon
    will appear just next to information on detail screen and Jan could translate texts from Slovak to Czech using
    Google Translate.
</p>
<p>
    Example 2: Vlado is using English language (localization) on his phone. He chooses Slovak as his preferred language
    in Settings and he also change localization to Slovak for this application. Vlado will see application's texts and
    information texts in Slovak and no Google Translate icon will appear on detail screen.
</p>
<p>
    Example 3: Jurij is using Russian language (localization) on his phone. Application doesn't support this
    localization so all application's text will be shown in English. Jurij chooses English as his preferred language in
    Settings (the application doesn't support Russian as preferred language yet). Application server will send
    information texts in English. Jurij didn't change application's localization (check box Change localization stays
    unchecked). Google Translate icon will appear just next to information on detail screen and Jurij could translate
    texts from English to Russian using Google Translate.
