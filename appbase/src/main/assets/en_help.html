<p>
    Application takes localization from the device on which it's running. Unsupported localization display texts from
    default localization (English).
</p>
<p>
    Information about flowers which are displayed on detail screen is different issue. Many languages are supported for
    flower's names and taxonomy. Latin names are displayed if localized names is missing. Other texts are downloaded
    from a server which currently supports only two languages: English and Slovak. If localization's language doesn't
    match preferred language Google Translate icon will appear on detailed screen just next to information about flower.
    Touch this icon to translate information to your localization's language using Google Translate. Touch again to
    return back information in preferred language.
</p>
<p>
    Example 1: Jan is using Czech language (localization) on his phone. Application supports this localization so all
    application's text will be shown in Czech as well as flower's names and taxonomy. All detail texts are displayed in
    English. Google Translate icon will appear just next to information on detail screen and Jan could translate texts
    from English to Czech using Google Translate.
</p>
<p>
    Example 2: Vlado is using English language (localization) on his phone. He chooses Slovak as his preferred language
    in Settings and he also change localization to Slovak for this application. Vlado will see application's texts and
    information texts in Slovak and no Google Translate icon will appear on detail screen.
</p>
<p>
    Example 3: Tarun is using Hindi language (localization) on his phone. Application doesn't support this
    localization so all application's text will be shown in English, but flower's names and taxonomy will be show in
    Hindi for these flowers which have Hindi names defined, other names will be in Latin. Google Translate icon will
    appear just next to information on detail screen and Tarun could translate texts from English to Hindi using
    Google Translate.
